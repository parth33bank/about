# About 
VMware has an amazing program called Take3 that allows its employees with over 5 years tenure to take 3 months to experience another role or take a sabbatical. Having been here at VMware for more than 6 years,<!--more--> I decided to take up this opportunity with the support of my management and explore the Product Management role which has been a passion of mine for quite some time. <!--more-->I had spent most of 2019 working on a Product Management certification from University of Washington where i learnt a lot about Product Ideation, User centric Design and Go to market strategies.

## 30 days
The first 30 days of my Product Management experience was busy, busy, busy… I spent a lot of time on the basics
* Understanding the technology and domain
* Installing our product (over and over again) 
* Breaking it and providing feedback
* Learning from the team and understanding the dynamics. 

This helped me get a good understanding our the technology, its constraints and its capabilities along with familiarizing with the team.
 
## 60 days
During my second month into Product Management, as i started getting the hang of the technology and it's constraints, I started to analysing our Product from a Product Management lens. Research time.. 
* What was the problem that we are trying to solve? 
* What is most important to our users? 
* Who are our Users and our Customers?
